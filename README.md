# Modeling Customer Churn

The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model to determine which customers are likely to leave a telecom company. Once customers are identified, the customer service team will contact them proactively to determine why they might leave. Resulting strategies to lower churn could include addressing individual customer concerns by customer service or general engineering improvements or sales policy changes. To identify general improvements, we do not need to identify every churn instance, only enough to get sufficient customer feedback.


# The Dataset

The dataset was comprised of twenty columns. The features listed in red below were the columns not used in the analysis. Charges were based on the number of minutes used and therefore were removed due to multicollinearity.
