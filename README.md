# Movie Genre Analysis

The premise of this project is that Microsoft has decided to start a movie studio and needs recommendations on the best movies to produce.  This analysis will focus on the best grossing movies from 2019, 2020, and all time to determine the most profitable movies based on domestic box office gross.


# The Dataset

Data were collected from the Box Office Mojo web site.  The movies selected were the top 200 movies of three lists:  all time grossing movies, highest grossing movies of 2019 and highest grossing movies of 2020.  The lists of 2019 and 2020 were limited to 200 movies since movies below that generated small enough revenue ($2.2 million and $150,000 respectively) that they would not be of interest to a major player in the movie industry.  The resulting set was a total of 551 movies.

Movies were compared on genre, number of genres each movie contained, and MPAA ratings, all on the basis of each movieâ€™s domestic gross.
